==========
*A source control all our own*

---

Welcome to git, valued team member. 
It's a little bare right now, but this will be our home when we start
coding for the hackathon. If you haven't used git before, feel free to clone 
the sample java app. 

If you have never used source control before, you may want a GUI
client. I recomend Source Tree if you are on windows.
